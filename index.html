            <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="content">This website helps make appointments with doctors across various clinics and days. Users were divided into two groups, A and B, each asked to schedule a specific appointment using a different website interface. Our aim is to determine if these interface changes would influence user behaviors when interacting with the interface. We analyzed misclick rate, time on page, and time to first click between the two groups. Results showed a big difference: Group B spent shorter time on the task. This finding may imply version B is more efficient to use and help improve user experience.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p class="content">Version A shows higher variances across all metrics measured, indicating a wider spread of data points around the mean. This may imply version A’s data are less accurate compared to version B. And version A’s average time on page and average time to first click are both higher, showing version A’s interface may be less efficient for users to interact with.</p>
